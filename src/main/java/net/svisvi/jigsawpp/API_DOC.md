**API DOC**

Here you can read about some methods and other stuff, which should be called in an inapropriate way.

**Special Effect giving, Purgative, Poop:**

These effects (if you want condition checkers and lots of fun) should be granted through special methods inside of them.
For example

*/effects/PoopEffect#addEffectGasWay()* 

will grant effect, checking for gas mask and do some stuff to it, if coded enough


**Purgen pilules ++effect and durationBuff**:

duration buff you grant to an itemstack through

*/item/pilule/AbstractPiluleItem#setDurationBuff()*
*/item/pilule/AbstractPiluleItem#setPurity()*

additional effect you grant through 

*PotionUtils#setCustomEffects*

Actual documentation for pilules you can see in the MossElephantThumb class
